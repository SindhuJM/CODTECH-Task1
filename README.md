Objectives

The goal of this program is to provide a basic calculator functionality that can perform four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also handles potential issues like invalid inputs or division by zero.

Key Activities

  1.Defining Functions for Arithmetic Operations:Each function takes two numbers as inputs and returns the result of the respective arithmetic operation.
  2.User Input for Numbers:The program prompts the user to enter two numbers using the input() function.
  3.Selecting the Operation:After the user inputs the numbers, they are asked to choose an arithmetic operation by selecting the corresponding number (1 for add, 2 for subtract, etc.).
  4.Performing the Operation:Based on the user’s choice of operation, the appropriate function is called (e.g., add, subtract, etc.), and the result is printed.
  5.Handling Edge Cases:If the user inputs non-numeric data, a ValueError is raised, and an error message is shown.If the user selects division and the second number is zero, an error 
    message is returned to avoid a runtime exception.
  6.Output:After performing the calculation, the result is displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., "The result of 3 + 5 is 8").

Technologies Used

  1.Python Functions:Functions like add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() are used to modularize the code, making it more readable and maintainable.
  2.Input Handling:input() is used to gather user input from the console.The program also uses float() to convert the input to numerical values and validate that they are valid numbers.
  3.Control Flow (Conditionals):if, elif, and else statements are used to control the flow of the program based on the user’s choices for the arithmetic operation.
  4.Error Handling (Exception Handling):A try block is used to handle cases where the user might input something that isn’t a valid number, using ValueError to catch the exception.A 
    check is added in the divide() function to ensure that division by zero is avoided.
  5.Basic Arithmetic Operations:Simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are implemented using standard Python operators.
